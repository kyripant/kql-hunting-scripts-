# üîç KQL Hunting Scripts Repository

## üéØ Scope and Purpose
This repository is dedicated to building and sharing a collection of **Kusto Query Language (KQL) hunting queries** that empower security teams to:

- **Detect threats** across authentication, network, endpoint, and cloud environments  
- **Investigate anomalies** that may indicate malicious or suspicious activity  
- **Enhance detection engineering** in Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender, and other Azure-based security platforms  
- **Accelerate incident response** by providing ready-to-use queries for common attack techniques  

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a **practical knowledge base** of reusable KQL hunting scripts that help security professionals improve visibility, identify adversary behaviors, and strengthen defenses.

## üìå Who Is This For?
- **Security Analysts** looking for pre-built hunting queries to speed up investigations  
- **Detection Engineers** interested in building or fine-tuning detection logic  
- **Threat Hunters** who want to map queries to adversary tactics and techniques (MITRE ATT&CK)  
- **Students & Learners** exploring cybersecurity and Microsoft Sentinel  

---

## üìÇ Scope of Coverage
This repository covers a wide range of scenarios, including but not limited to:
- **Authentication & Identity**: brute-force, impossible travel, unusual sign-ins  
- **Network**: DNS anomalies, port scanning, suspicious outbound traffic  
- **Endpoint**: PowerShell obfuscation, ransomware behavior, process anomalies  
- **Cloud & SaaS**: risky OAuth apps, mailbox rule abuse, anomalous Azure AD activity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These queries are shared **free of charge** and **without warranty**.  
They are intended for **educational and detection engineering purposes only**.  
Thresholds, filters, and logic must be **adapted to your environment** to reduce false positives.
